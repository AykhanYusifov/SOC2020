## May 26, 2020: Publishing with Markdown

### Preparation

- [Install Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), the versatile document converter

- Install a suitable text editor.  Here are a few examples:

	- ``Vi`` / ``Vim``, the standard text editor of the Unix world (free)
	- ``Textwrangler`` or ``BBEdit`` (not free)
	- ``Atom``
	- ``Notepad++`` (but not just Notepad or Wordpad)

- Bring a sample of one of your recent products.  This could be a term paper, a publication, an excerpt from your thesis/dissertation, or a tutorial you may have developed or something else along those lines.  You do not need to share this with others, it's for your own use only.  

- Bring questions and comments about your own workflows.  We will reserve the last 30 minutes for this.  Remember that this is a forum, so let the information flow in all directions.
